<h2 id="technologies">Technologies üíª</h2>

- **Swift 5.9+**: The primary language for all app logic
- **SwiftUI**: Declarative UI for all screens and navigation
- **Combine**: Reactive programming for state management and event handling
- **MVVM + Router architecture**: Separation of data, view logic, and UI
- **Foundation**: Codable for quiz data, timer logic, etc.

<h2 id="architecture">Architecture üèóÔ∏è</h2>

The app embraces the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern:
- **Model**: `Quiz`, `QuizQuestion`, and related structs handle quiz data, scoring, and state
- **ViewModel**: `QuizViewModel` manages quiz logic, progress, timer, and score updates
- **View**: SwiftUI views such as `QuizSelfView`, `ProgressBarView`, and more render the UI and bind to view models
- **Router**: `AppRouter` handles navigation and path management

<h2 id="testing">Testing üß™</h2>

The project is structured for easy extensibility with unit tests. Suggested tests:
- **Quiz Logic**: Validate question selection, scoring, and timer
- **ViewModel**: Test state updates for answer selection and progression

<h2 id="documentation">Documentation üìö</h2>

All significant classes, methods, and properties use Apple's DocC format for in-source documentation.
- **Description**: Explains type or method purpose
- **Parameters**: Each parameter and its role
- **Returns**: What is returned and when

Example:
```swift
/// Toggles the display of the hint popover for the current question.
internal func isShowingHintPopoverToggle() {
    isShowingHintPopover.toggle()
}
